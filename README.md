# PowerTrack - Battery Monitoring App ⚡🔋

PowerTrack is a lightweight Android app, inspired by the Ampere app, that provides real-time battery insights, including charging status, battery health, temperature, voltage, and charging/discharging current (mA).

## Features ✨
- ✅ **Charging Status:** Detects AC, USB, and wireless charging.
- ✅ **Battery Percentage & Health:** Displays real-time battery level and health status.
- ✅ **Voltage & Temperature:** Monitors battery voltage (V) and temperature (°C).
- ✅ **Device Information:** Shows manufacturer, model, and Android version.
- ✅ **Real-time Current (mA):** Displays charging/discharging current with accurate values.
